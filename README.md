# Tamagotchi with JS Objects and TS Classes

**What is this?**
- this repository houses a basic JS object and a TS class designed to mimic the classic Japanese game Tamagotchi
- the purpose of this repo is to expand on a General Assembly homework assignment in order to learn how Classes work in Typescript

**Next steps**
- create an interface to play with the Tamagotchi
- alter the methods of both the Object and the Class to accept user input
- determine a way to set default values for the properties of the Object and Class that should not be set by a user (e.g. isHappy, age, lifeStage)
